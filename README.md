# Trivia

Deployed Game: https://enigmatic-inlet-02459.herokuapp.com/

Welcome to my trivia game. To view code, npm install and npm start. This game guides players through a series of 10 random questions and for each submision the player is notified of whether or not their answer if correct through red and green highlights. At the end of the game, the player is informed his score, his time of completion, and his personal best score.

I really enjoyed building this app especially the css portion (the responsive layout, the blinking logo, the hover button effect and the glow). I had a lot of fun seeing my creation come to life and my progression with the added features. Some extra features I added include a timer to keep track of the time and a local storage to keep track of a player's best score. For the future, I would like to build a multiplayer version that also has a chat box feature.
